## Exercise 1

Exercise 1: Find the First Prime Number in a Range
Write a program to find the first prime number between 10 and 50. Use break to exit the loop once the first prime number is found.

## Exercise 2

Exercise 2: Find a Specific Value in a 2D Array (Using Labels)
Given a 2D array of integers, find the first occurrence of the number 7. Use a labeled break to exit both loops when the value is found. Example Input:

Example Input:

```
int[][] array = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};

```

Expected Output: "Found at row 2, column 0"

## Exercise 3

Exercise 3: Skip Multiples of 3
Write a program that iterates through numbers from 1 to 20 and prints all numbers except those divisible by 3. Use continue.

## Exercise 4

Exercise 4: Skip Specific Rows in a 2D Array (Using Labels)
Write a program that iterates through a 2D array of integers. Print all values except those in rows that contain a 0. Use a labeled continue to skip entire rows.

Example Input:

```
int[][] array = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 0, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```

Expected Output:

```
1 2 3
7 8 9
```

## Exercise 5

Exercise 5: Find the First Palindrome
Write a method that takes an array of strings and returns the first palindrome it encounters. Use return to exit the method as soon as the palindrome is found.

Example Input: {"apple", "level", "banana", "radar"}

Expected Output: "level"

## Exercise 6 

Exercise 6: Find a Match in a 2D Array (Using Labels)
Write a method that takes a 2D array of integers and a target value, and returns the coordinates (row, column) of the first match. Use a labeled return to exit both loops immediately after finding the match.

Example Input:

```
int[][] array = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
int target = 6;

Expected Output: "Found at row 1, column 2"
```
